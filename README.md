## Project setup üìã

- This news app is built on `Flutter` and that's why we need `flutter` and `dart` installed
- After the successful installation and setup of `flutter`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:

 ```properties
   git clone https://github.com/thisisprabhat/dailydose.git
 ```
This will clone the whole repository in your system.

- Then run `flutter pub get` to get the packages listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
- This project uses a news api form gnews.com, so we need to get an api key and include it in the project in `lib/constants/api_key.dart`
```dart
const String kApiKey = "ENTER YOUR OWN API KEY FROM [https://gnews.io]";
```
- Now the project is ready to use

### Pending
* Responsive ui for web and desktop
* Localization
